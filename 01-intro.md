## What is a Second Brain

The amount of information that our brains receive and process throughout each day is just too much. We spend countless hours on consuming information but never focus on retaining that info for later.


Enter the second brain, A place to store all of the information that we receive and reuse it when we need it. In the modern age, everyone needs two brains. One for processing information and one for storing all that processed information.

> A second brain allows you to store virtually anything that you want and create
> relationships between different pieces of data that you have stored.

## The C.O.D.E Method

The CODE method is a simple way to save, refine, and reuse the information from your second brain. There are four steps in the CODE method:

- **Capture:** The first part of the method is to save information however you like it can be in any form or shape.

- **Organize:** The second part is to organize all that data that you have captured according to the subject your currently working on.

- **Distill:** In the third step we remove the unwanted information from our second brain so that it doesn't clutter up and keep only the things that are important.

- **Express:** The final step is expressing your refined information and share it with the world or use it in a project

## The P.A.R.A system

The PARA system consists of four parts which you can use to organize your second brain effectively.

- **Projects:** Short term goals or tasks that you are working on.

- **Areas:** Long term goals that you want to manage overtime.

- **Resources:** Links, or other things that help you in your work.

- **Archives:** Inactive projects or the projects that have been completed.

You can use the PARA system to organize all the information you find to store in your second brain
