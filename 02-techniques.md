## Twelve problems

Richard feynman, one of the greatest minds of all time invented a system which he called his twelve favorite problems. He would keep at keep thinking about at least twelve different problems in his mind at all times.


When he found something new he would apply that to all twelve problems so that he could make some progress in atleast one of the problems.

## Divide and Conquer

Software engineers, Product managers, Architects, and almost all professionals use the divide and conquer streategy to solve their problems. Dividing a bigger problem into smaller ones is a great approach to easily solve problems.

> The author calls these smaller problems *Intermediate packets*.

You can have five kinds of intermediate packets:

- **Distilled notes:** Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain

- **Out-takes:** The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones.

- **Work-in-process:** The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects.

- **Final deliverables:** Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new.

- **Documents created by others:** Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work.

## Converge and Diverge

When you close all connections with the outside world and only focus on the work you are doing then you are in the convergence mode. In divergence mode, you open your horizons and try to gather as much information about the topic you are looking for and collect a bundle of information.

## Create bridges between your work

Ernest hemingway created a process for his wiriting called the Hemingway bridge. This process implies that you don't stop working untill you can define the next part of the project for your future self.


This way you don't get off track and don't spend any time figuring out wat you did yesterday and where should you continue from today.

## Miss en Place

Culinary chefs have a particular system for running there restaurants called *Miss en place.* They place all of their required ingredients in order of what goes first as  placeholders so that they can easily grab what is needed.
